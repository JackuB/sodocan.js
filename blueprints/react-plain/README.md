#react-plain blueprint

So this one is totally empty! Since React itself is just for the View,
this blueprint will get filled in when the vanilla (ES6) API module is ready.

This blueprint will likely end up as a display page for components more than
a good design base. Feel free to file issues or PRs using redux or whatever,
not sure what would be the most help for React design!
