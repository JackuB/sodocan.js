# Sodocan Blueprints

Blueprints are drop-in sites for use with the server or (future) static site generator.

Shared files (mostly base vendor & sodocan dependencies) will live in framework-common,
individual sites will live in framework-name -- this is _work in progress_.

More specific documentation for a given framework can be found in the \*-common README.
